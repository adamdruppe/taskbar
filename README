My small hacked panel 2.0
Originally based on fspanel by Peter Zelezny
with some code from Docker  by Ben Jansens

Heavily changed by me, Adam D. Ruppe, in 2007
Ported to D by me in 2014.

License: GPL
Dependencies: simpledisplay.d and color.d from
	      https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd



While it started with a small, customizable taskbar,
this is now a bit bigger (the port to D kinda bloated
the binary, oh well, but it will make new things easier
to write so I think it is worth it, besides, my new computer
can spare 200 KB) and not as easily changed.

As I continue development, some customization ease will
return, but it is still written for me and me alone. If it
is useful to you, cool, and if not, oh well, I put it up here
just for the heck of it rather than any practical purpose.


Features include: window icons, workspace awareness, a clock,
a small notification area, and a size+theme that works well
on my screen. Minimal wasted screen space.

Controls:

left click lowers or raises and focuses a window.
middle click temporarily moves a window to the left of the taskbar
  (this is undone when you switch workspaces)
right click closes a window. There is no confirmation btw.


If you shade a window, it goes grey. Iconfiying a window makes it
disappear entirely.

The way I use X, I shade things when I don't care right now and iconify
when I want them open, but totally out of the way - I can then retrieve
them with the middle click menu on Blackbox.



The taskbar also auto-hides on workspaces 6 and up. That's where I like
to run full-screen VMs and don't need a Linux taskbar in the way.
